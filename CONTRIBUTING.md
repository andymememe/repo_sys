# Contributing

## Report Issue
**IMPORTANT: Report an issue first and ensure the way to do it before change and Pull Request**
* 2 types of issue
    1. Bug report
    2. Feature request
* Search first! Do not file an issue twice!
* Use Issue template to file an issue.
* Complete all the information in the template. Make sure to put all the details on it.
* Everyone is welcome to file issues and write comments.

## Pull Request
* Fork the repo first.
* Open a new branch from "master" branch, use tags from GitFlow (hotfix, feature) for each type of issue to name the branch, e.g., hotfix/fix-X.
* Use one of 3 types (Fix, Feature, BREAKING CHANGE) from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) and write details of all the changes in the description when commiting.
* Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
* File the Pull Request and discuss.
* Never change the version of libraries or other requirements without my permission. I will post an announcement for any change of the requirements.

### Coding Standard
**PS: Some of my old code may use it, but don't do it for the newer one. I will fix them when I found them.**
* Do not use Java-like braces. Use like the example shown below.
```java
    if ()
    {
        // Good
    }
```
* Only leave one space after semi-colons in "for" statements.
* Function names are not separated from the first parenthesis.
* Avoid magic numbers.
* Use snake-case and easy-to-understand variables' name.
* Use all caps for constants.
* Use camel-case and begin with a lower case for methods' name.
* Use capitalized name for classes.
* Avoid all the bad smell.
* Rules can change for different languages if it's necessary.

## The last but not the least
* Be **nice** to everyone.
* Follow **this rules, Code of Conduct and the license**. Especially if you want to use it **for commercial products**.
